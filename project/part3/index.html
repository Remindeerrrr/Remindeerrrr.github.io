    <div class="pageText">
    <p>In Minecraft, a creeper is a common hostile mob, characterized by its distinctive appearance and behavior.
         Creepers are one of the most recognizable and iconic creatures in the game.
          They have a green, almost plant-like body with four legs and no arms. 
          Their most notable feature is their ability to silently approach players and explode, 
          causing significant damage to nearby players and structures.</p>
